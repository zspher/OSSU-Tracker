# Exercise 4: Assume that we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
# For each of the following expressions, write the value of the expression and the type (of the value of the expression).

# 1. width//2 
# 2. width/2.0
# 3. height/3
# 4. 1 + 2 * 5

print("1. ", width//2)    # 8
print("2. ", width/2.0)   # 8.5
print("3. ", height/3)    # 4.0
print("4. ", 1 + 2 * 5)   # 11
