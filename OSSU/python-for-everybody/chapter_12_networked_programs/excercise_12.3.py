# Exercise 3: Use urllib to replicate the previous exercise of (1) retrieving the document from a URL, (2) displaying up to 3000 characters, and (3) counting the overall number of characters in the document. Donâ€™t worry about the headers for this exercise, simply show the first 3000 characters of the document contents.

import urllib.request 
import sys

url = input("Enter a Url txt file: ")
try:
  data = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
except:
  print('improperly formatted or non-existent URL')
  sys.exit()


count = 0
for line in data:
  for char in line.decode():
    count += 1
    if count <= 3000:
      print(char, end='')
print('\n')
print(count)
