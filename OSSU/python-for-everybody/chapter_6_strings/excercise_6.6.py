# Exercise 6: Read the documentation of the string methods at https://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods You might want to experiment with some of them to make sure you understand how they work. strip and replace are particularly useful.

# The documentation uses a syntax that might be confusing. For example, in find(sub[, start[, end]]), the brackets indicate optional arguments. So sub is required, but start is optional, and if you include start, then end is optional.

x = 'From marquard@uct.ac.za'
print(x[9])
